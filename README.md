## General Info
The code, here, is written in the course of working through *Project Euler*.
 
## Technologies Used
The code will be written in Typescript and tested using JestJS.
 
## Contents
### Multiples of 3 and 5 
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Even Fibonacci Numbers
Each term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Setup
No setup necessary for this project.
 
## Usage
The code from the various sections of the project will be largely executed through the testing of the code to ensure that a correct solution has been found.
```
    npm test
```
 
## Project Status
The project will be in an ongoing status until the code for each section is completed and Project Euler has been completed as well.
 
## Room for Improvement
Similarly to the above section of this document, there can be seen a general room for improvement as the greater project associated with this project is a learning project.
